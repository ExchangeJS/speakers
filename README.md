# Guidelines for Speakers

Exchange.js talks include topics relevant to JavaScript programming and web development. Generally, talks fall into one of the following categories:

- beginning JavaScript *(15 minute, eg. variables, scope, functions, code flows, async)*
- advanced JavaScript *(20 minute, eg. design patterns, unit testing, frameworks)*
- roundtable discussions *(20 minutes, moderated by an expert)*
- demos *(10 minutes, no slides)*

To keep the meeting on time, talks will be timed.

Slots fill quickly so [add your name, email, and topic to our signup sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_FOG1K_fUbTlNvqT9hjihiXYt9AhPkZxW6tfZN858VU/edit?usp=sharing) if you haven't already.

## Tips

### Preparation of slides

1. As a rule of thumb, **a single slide takes about 1 min to present**. So presentations should be between 15 and 25 slides long.

1. **Show don't tell**. Don't use too much text as you'll be speaking at the same time. Wherever a point can be made with a visual instead of text, use it.

1. **Use a descriptive title to describe the content of each slide**. If someone spaces out for a moment, they can always read the title and catch up.

1. Remember that when reading code, different audience members will need different amounts of time to absorb the significance of each part. In a talk, everyone has to be moving at the same pace to keep with the speaker. **Keep code samples minimal** and use highlighting, arrows, and "appearance" animations to make them easier to absorb and **emphasize** the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red">main</span>  &rarr;point&larr;.

1. Your **notes and code should be readable from a distance** and on small screens (like when watching recordings on a phone).

1. Your **notes and code should work on a projector**. Contrast is your friend. Assume you only have a dark, light, and midrange colour. The lighter themes tend to work better for code samples.

1. **Acknowledge the community that made your talk possible.** Who maintains the project you're using? Did someone help you get your talk ready or learn a new technology?

1. **Explain how to get help**. This could be sharing your contact details, or suggesting a community forum.

1. **Anticipate common questions** and prepare answers and slides to address them.

1. If your talk is part of a series, **explain what came before and what's next**. How can you watch these?

1. **Share the url of your talk** so people can review afterwards.

### Preperation of demos

1. **Install all dependencies** required to run your demo in advance.

1. Make sure you can **work with slow or broken internet**. Trust us it happens.

1. Your **demo and code should be understandable from a distance**. Reduce your screen resolution, or up your IDE font size.

### Preparation of presentations

1. **You will be timed, so practice**. Have an idea of what you will say for each slide and how you will transition between them. Then make sure your talk is about the right length. We can make someone available if you want to practice in front of an audience.

1. We record directly from the HDMI out going into the projector, so **make sure your machine has a working HDMI** or Display Port connector.

1. **Charge your battery** or bring an extra power supply.

### Giving your talk

1. By speaking at the Exchange.js meetup, **you agree to our [Code of conduct](https://www.exchangejs.com/code-of-conduct/)**.

1. **Stand still**. You don't need to stand behind the podium but stand still if you want us to keep you in the video.

1. If you take questions, please repeat them back for those that didn't hear.

1. **Relax. You're the best.**

### After your talk

1. It's great if you can hang around for a bit and answer questions.

1. Ideally we'd like a link to each presentation, so post the slides (in HTML or a downloadable format) and send us the link.
