# Guidelines for Speakers

Exchange.js talks include topics relevant to JavaScript programming and web development. Generally, talks fall into one of the following categories:

- beginning JavaScript *(eg. variables, functions)*
- advanced JavaScript *(eg. design patterns, unit testing)*
- tooling *(eg. WebKit, TypeScript)*
- frameworks and libraries *(eg. Ember, Lodash)*
- general web development and design *(eg. HTTP, accessibility)*

Talks should be 25 min long, with up to 10 min set aside for questions. To keep the meeting on time, talks will be timed.

## Tips

### Preparation of slides

1. It is recommended that speakers prepare their slides using [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) as this will make archiving easier. However, Keynote and Powerpoint may be used.

1. As a rule of thumb, a single slide takes about 1 min to present. So presentations should be between 15 and 25 slides long.

1. **Show don't tell**. Don't use too much text as you'll be speaking at the same time. Wherever a point can be made with a visual instead of text, use it.

1. Use titles that describe the content of the slide. If someone spaces out for a moment, they can always read the title and catch up.

1. Remember that when reading code, different audience members will need different amounts of time to absorb the significance of each part. In a talk, everyone has to be moving at the same pace to keep with the speaker. Keep code sample minimal and use highlighting, arrows, and "appearance" animations to make them easier to absorb and **emphasize** the <span style="font-weight:"bold"; font-color:"red"> main &rarr;point&larr;.

### Preparation of presentations

1. You will be timed, so practice. Have an idea of what you will say for each slide and how you will transition between them. Then make sure your talk is about the right length.

1. For recording purposes you'll have to set up Google Hangouts and have Wifi available.

### Giving your talk

1. By speaking at the Exchange.js meetup, you agree to our [Code of conduct](https://www.exchangejs.com/code-of-conduct.html).

1. Relax. You're the best.
